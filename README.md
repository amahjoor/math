## Abstract
This project aims to leverage AI to enhance math education by developing an AI-powered system capable of identifying and providing feedback on handwritten, common algebraic errors. Drawing from six years of experience in math education and inspired by AI applications, the project integrates two separate models: one using MathPIX and GPT-4 for evaluation, which represents the intended final product, and another developed in TensorFlow to explore neural network approaches for checking math errors.

## Introduction
Students Errors may provide potential for students to learn, as well as meaningful indicators for educators [3]. Fisher and Lipson proposed three learning strategies with errors [2]: locating errors, finding the reason for the errors, and planning for preventing the errors. GPT-4 has significantly
